IN TRODUOTION. ·

Tau subject of which the ‘Menaechmci' of Plautus would
seem to be the earliest extant version, air. the mistakes
and ‘errors' crising from the deceptiva resemblance of

two brothers, fumishes a very happy plot for a lively .

comio entertainment, and has, therefore, been in great
favour with the comic poeta of almost all natione of
Europe. It was formerly supposed that this plot was
derived from the Siciliam poet Epicharmus, who spent the
latter part of his life at Syracuse at the court of Hiero,
and died at the age of 90 (450 nc.) or 97 (443 nc).
This view was founded on the statamcnt of the prologus
to the Menaechmci, v. 12, according to which the plot of
the play sicelissct-an expression erroneously understood
aa applying to the Siciliae eripio of the plot, while it
merely denotea that the events in the play are in some
way connected with Sicily, or that the preliminaries of
the plot take place in that island. This supposition
was further strengthened hythe somewhat vagus expres-
sion of Horace, Ep. 111, 58 (dicitur) Plautus ad complut·
sicut properare Epicharmi. But this does not mean
that Plautus ever took a plot from Epicharmus, but only
drawa a parallel between the easy and rapid development
of the single events of the plot of a Plautina play and
the plays of Epicharmus.

It is certain that Plautus derived the plote of his
plays from the rich stores of tho so-called Νέα Κωμῳδία,
and it is among the numerous poeta and plays of that
branch of Greek literature that we shall have to look for
the original inventor of the plot of the 'present play. A
