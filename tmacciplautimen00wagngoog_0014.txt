abounds in comic power. The single situations 'of tha
plot do not, indeed, originale hum an inuer causa which
furnishos the creative power of them, but arise all the
more powerfully from mere fancy and an inexhaustible
fund of boisterous humour, prompted by Chauco itselr‘,
the real deity of Comedy. The plot is of less depth than
the Aulularia, but ,it surpasses that play in its almost in·
describable power of amusing, and is after all constructed
in such a manner that we cannot mistalre 'chance ior

In 1594 a Coreedy of Errare (‘ like to Plautus his
Menaechmus ') was acted at Gray's Inn. Shalrspere's
