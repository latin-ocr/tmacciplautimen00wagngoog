small detail, insignificant at first sight, seems 10 help us

in tracing the Greek poet Itis a little piecc 01 1111011110-
11011 supplied by Athenaeus, and reproduoed in our note
on v. 218. If it betrus that slave-cooks appeared, among
all the poete of the New Oomedy, only in the comedies of
Posidippuc, we cannot reasonably doubt that he was the
author 01 the Greek original, which has survived in the ’
Latin adaptation of Plautus. It has been pointed out by
Ladewig, that c'ooks played a conspicuous part in the
plays 01 Posidippus, as may still be seen 110111 the few
fragments extent¹3 and as Gellius 11 23 observes that the
plays 01 Posidippris were employed by Roman adaptare, l
we may easily suppose that Plautus was glad to avail
himself 01 suche capital plot which was sure to 1111111111
much amusement 10 his audience.

It has been conjectured that the Greek original bore
the title 01 Δῶυμοι, which was also that 01 several other
plays 01 the New Comedy mentioned by ancient authors.
Such plays are attributed to Antiphanes, Anaxandrides,
Alexiua Xenarchus and Euphron‚ and there rs a 1113111101

mentioned among the plays 01 Menander.

Though there are several allusions to Roman customs ,
in the Plautino plays-and, 111 fact, 1101 one is free from
such admixtures-we need not suppose that the plot of
the Greek original was in any way altered by the Roman
adapter. We do not know when Plautus wrote his
Menaechmei, and there is not the slightest foundation 101
the supposition which attributes this comedy 10 the
earlier part 01 the poet's literary career. The passage re
